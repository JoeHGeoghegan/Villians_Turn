# Villian's Turn - Custom Group Turn Tracker / Combat Helper
Tool to provide tabletop support.

Uses Streamlit
Uses the [streamlit_autorefresh](https://github.com/kmcgrady/streamlit-autorefresh) library's st_autorefresh function meaning I cannot get it hosted on streamlit. Unfortunately looks like I will need to rip their code into this project to bypass that issue. Credit where credit is due - great functionality and I couldn't have had such a smooth experience without their library.
