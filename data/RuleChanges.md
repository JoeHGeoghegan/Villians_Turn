# DND Group and Combo Rule Mods
*By Joe Geoghegan*

## Rule Change - Turn Order & Initiative:
### Groups:
Turns will now be given out to entire Groups at once. Groups can consist of the entire party, a single member, or anything in between. A member in a group can leave that group and join another group by holding their action until the desired group has their turn. Initial group composition is based off the Initiation Roll with enemies splitting the players into groups. Low initiative players are not "looped around" into the high initiative group but are able to hold their action until the next turn. When a player holds their action, and wants to switch their group, they should state their intention of where they want to move to, group wise.

Example: A party of four adventurers is fighting two wolves and a bear. The Party's initiation rolls are 20, 15, 10, and 5. The First Wolf rolled a 12, the second an 8, and the Bear rolled a 3. The Initial Groups would be: 
|   |   |
| :--- | :--- |
| Group A: Two Party members | Group D: Second Wolf |
| Group B: a wolf | Group E: Final Member |
| Group C: Member #3 | Group F: The bear | 

On the first turn Group C and E would likely merge for to utilize the new Combo Rule described below, this action would naturally merge the Wolves' groups as well, streamlining combat (and giving the wolves the possibility to combo if desired). The two Player Groups could further merge.
### Disrupting Groups:
Forming a new Group is also possible and allows characters to disrupt enemy groups. A single character, player or enemy, can hold their action until the desired place in the turn order and form a new group, they should state to the DM they plan to Disrupt a group. No other person can join that group for that turn. Forming new groups should be used to disrupt the other side's combos. When a group is broken apart in this way they are broken up by initiative and the DM's judgement. Skill checks could be used to increase the difficulty of breaking up groups if desired. Example: A 3-character group with initiative rolls of 1, 20, and 24 is about to be disrupted up by a character with initiative roll of 19. If the Disruptor wanted to break the enemy group to separate out the 1 from the 20 and 24, that might be okay and the DM might not give a single skill check. If the Disruptor wanted to separate out the 24, it might require a skill check.

When a Disruptor fails a skill check, I suggest the DM can decide: If the Disruptor still stopped the combo attack or the enemies have to make their attacks separately. Where the disruptors new group falls in the turn order. And any other negative repercussions the DM might want to throw in. Consider putting the Disruptor where they wanted to be in the turn order but given the broken apart group some bonus or even an attack of opportunity.

When a Disruptor succeeds a skill check, the possibility to combo for the disrupted group is gone. I suggest the DM allows the disrupted group to still have all the turns they should have. The Disruptor disrupts, their turn would then pause. The first half of the disrupted group goes, then the Disruptor continues their turn. Followed by the second half of the disrupted group.

The Disruptor Role gives the assassin/lone wolf/crazy gladiator barbarian type characters a place to shine and effect the group is a positive and interesting way. Role play should be encouraged and DM Inspiration should be generously given when players describe how they disrupt. (We all know an archer can do more than just shoot a bow to disrupt something, encourage some flair!) 
### Optional Additional Rule Change:
Depending on how Disruption is used/ruled by the DM it might be determined that high initiative characters lose some perks with this system, I suggest that, on the first turn only, everyone (including enemies if desired) gets a flat bonus to all their rolls equal to their initiative bonus. This should lead to a bombastic first turn while people get the groups organized. (Example note: in the above initial group layout, if Group E wanted to join with Group A, either Group A would have to hold their action letting enemies go until they join with E or E would sacrifice their starting turn bonus to hold until A's second turn.)
## New Rule - Combo attacks:
Combo attacks are supposed to be a generous system which should get players to think about their turns proactively, get it so everyone rolls their dice at the same time - streamlining combat, and encourage roleplay! Theoretically this should allow for bigger, quicker turns, and cooler fights. Enemies can also use the combo system creating cool and interesting mechanic options. When the Combo attack system is used. It is probably wise to have enemies' health be 1.25 what they would have been naturally. This system will do more consistent damage. (The 1.25 modifier is considering attack rolls should theoretically be missing 25-50% of the time and now they will have options to perform minor damage, even when their attacks miss)

A combo attack can be done with two or more members who are in the same group. The members of the combo attack must describe how their abilities are being used in tandem. Creative uses of abilities should be generously given DM Inspiration and/or bonuses like moving the enemy desirably or inflicting status effects. Characters with multiple attacks can use multiple attacks within the same combo or join multiple combos (one combo per attack). Characters with multiple attacks cannot combo with themselves only.

When a combo attack is performed. All members roll their attack roll as necessary; the effected party rolls any Checks as necessary

When damage needs to be rolled:
> If the combo has any attack rolls - If one of the member's attack's hits everyone can then roll damage. People who missed their attack roll still do half damage rounded down.
> If the combo has any skill checks - The effected party rolls each check individually. It is the DM's choice if certain checks become harder or easier in each given situation. If a failed skill check would completely stop all damage from the ability from occurring (I.E. Catapult) consider allowing half damage to be done.
> If combos are being done along with area of effect abilities like Dust Devil, consider allowing damage to be done by the ability during the combo instead of at the end of the enemy turn.
> If the Combo features one attack roll and one skill check, if the combo's description is sound/novel/interesting, consider making it so a missed attack/ability check rolls still does half damage rounded down if the action fails.

Combos could also be performed using supporting actions like healing at the DM's discretion.

Most helping actions would only give a single member of the combo advantage.

Example: A wizard and a ranger are in a group. The wizard expresses they want to use Fireball, the ranger wants to fire their bow. They decide to do a combo attack. Possibilities they have:
> They can both fire off their attacks simultaneously. The enemy has to roll a dex check and the ranger rolls an attack roll. Damage is distributed as mention above.
> The Wizard could target the area behind the enemy wanting the blast to push the enemy into the flying arrow. Damage is distributed as mention above. The DM could give inspiration here for a cool combo. The DM could also move the enemy forward a space.
> The Wizard could target the Fireball point to be the tip of the arrow so when it gets lodged into the enemy it explodes inside the enemy's body to an extent. The DM could give inspiration, have the enemy fall prone or catch on fire, or direct the fireball explosion so it doesn't hit nearby allies. Damage is distributed as mention above.
## Additional Piece:
This has no effect on rules but a system I plan to use personally when DM'ing and it expands the possibilities of Combos.

Damage doesn't have to be reflected by actually inflicting damage to the person. In movies you see a person give up a fight after the other character threw a knife right next to their head, in my mind that did damage to them, the person got freaked out, they would need time to recover, they lost their will to fight. Healing items can easily be ruled to restore vigor and spirit and thematically still work to cure battle "wounds".

In my mind a person cannot train to be able to take more arrows to the stomach. One arrow should be fatal in most cases. So, with wounds to the spirit a character could dodge or reflect in the RP but it would still be registered as full damage.

This expands the combo system since now the Archer can do more than just hit the enemy, they can fire a distracting arrow, they can hold their arrow and give an absolutely devils smirk as the enemy is about to be engulfed by a Fireball.

This ruling also allows non-fatal damage to make more sense.

Personally, I would rule someone would start actually taking physical damage at the bottom quarter of their life pool.

Also, I would not apply this rule to barbarians. They are crazy, they earn their scars. (Maybe damage starts actually hitting their body at like 75% health when the enemy "earned" it)
