# D&D Group and Combo Rule Mods
*By Joe Geoghegan*

## Rule Changes: Turn Order & Initiative

### Grouping

In combat, turns are now given to entire groups at once. A group can be anything from the entire party to a single character. Players can switch groups by taking the Hold action and waiting until their desired group's turn. Low initiative players/enemies are not "looped around" into the high initiative group but are able to hold their action until the next turn. 

Initial groups are determined by the Initiative Roll, with enemies splitting players into groups. For example, if you have a party of four players fighting two wolves and a bear, the initial groups might be:

Example:
| Player Initiatives | Enemy Initiatives |
| :--- | :--- |
| Player A: 20 | Wolf 1: 12 |
| Player B: 15 | Wolf 2: 8 |
| Player C: 10 | Bear: 3 |
| Player D: 5 |  |

Based on these rolls, the initial groups would be:
* Group A: Player A and B
* Group B: Wolf 1
* Group C: Player C
* Group D: Wolf 2
* Group E: Player D
* Group F: Bear

On the first turn Group C and E would likely merge for to utilize the new Combo Rule described below, this action would naturally merge the Wolves' groups as well, streamlining combat (and giving the wolves the possibility to combo if desired). The two Player Groups could further merge.

### The Disruptor and Disrupting Groups

A single player or enemy can form a new single person group to disrupt an existing one. To do this, they take the Hold action, stating their intent to be a Disruptor against a specific group. No other character can join a new group created in this way for that turn.

Disrupting is a great way to break up an enemy's combo attack. A disrupted group is broken up by initiative and the Dungeon Master's (DM's) judgment. The DM may require a skill check to successfully disrupt a group, especially if the disruptor wants to separate characters with high initiative rolls.

If a Disruptor Fails a Skill Check

    The DM decides whether the combo is stopped or if the enemies must make their attacks separately.

    The DM determines where the disruptor's new group falls in the turn order.

    The DM can add negative consequences, like giving the broken-up group a bonus or an attack of opportunity.

If a Disruptor Succeeds a Skill Check

    The disrupted group can no longer perform a combo attack.

    The disruptor's turn is paused, and the first half of the disrupted group takes its turn.

    The disruptor resumes their turn, followed by the second half of the disrupted group.

This rule allows characters like rogues, barbarians, or assassins to shine by disrupting enemies in a strategic and interesting way. Players should be encouraged to describe their disruption with flair, and the DM should be generous with inspiration.

### Optional Rule: First-Turn Bonus

If you find that this new system puts high-initiative characters at a disadvantage, you can add this optional rule: on the first turn only, all characters (including enemies) receive a bonus to all rolls equal to their initiative bonus. This should make for a more explosive first turn while groups are still getting organized.

## New Rule: Combo Attacks

Combo attacks encourage players to be more proactive and creative, streamline combat, and make for more exciting battles. They can also be used by enemies, which creates interesting tactical options. Because this system allows for more consistent damage, consider increasing enemy hit points by 25%.

### How Combos Work

Two or more characters in the same group can perform a combo attack. To do so, they must describe how their abilities work together. DMs should be generous with inspiration and bonuses for creative combos, such as moving an enemy or inflicting a status effect. Characters with multiple attacks can use them within a single combo or join multiple combos (one combo per attack). A character cannot combo with themself.

When performing a combo, all participating characters roll their attack rolls or skill checks as necessary.

### Damage Ruling Posibilities/Example Benefits

* Attacks: If one of the participating characters hits with their attack roll, everyone in the combo can roll damage. Characters who missed their attack roll still do half damage (rounded down).

* Skill Checks: If the combo uses skill checks, the affected party rolls each one individually. The DM can decide if certain checks are harder or easier within the combo. If a failed skill check would normally prevent all damage from an ability (e.g., Catapult), consider allowing half damage to be dealt instead.

* Mixed Combos: If a combo features both an attack roll and a skill check, and the combo's description is creative or interesting, consider letting a missed attack or failed skill check still do half damage (rounded down).

* Area of Effect (AoE) Spells: For AoE abilities like Dust Devil, consider allowing the damage to be dealt during the combo attack instead of at the end of the enemy's turn.

* Supporting Actions: DMs can allow combos to include supporting actions like healing. Most helping actions should give a single member of the combo advantage.

* Inspiration: Reward your players for doing fun and cool things! Give DM Inspiration bonuses!

Example:
A wizard and a ranger are in the same group. The wizard wants to use Fireball, and the ranger wants to fire their bow. They decide to do a combo attack. Possibilities they have:

* Simultaneous Attack: They can fire their attacks simultaneously. The enemy must make a Dexterity save, and the ranger makes an attack roll. Damage is distributed as described above.

* Push Combo: The wizard could target the area behind the enemy, using the Fireball blast to push the enemy into the path of the ranger's arrow. The DM could give inspiration for this clever combo and might even move the enemy forward a space.

* Creative Combo: The wizard could target the Fireball to explode at the tip of the ranger's arrow as it gets lodged in the enemy, causing an internal explosion. The DM could give inspiration, make the enemy fall prone or catch on fire, or even let the wizard direct the blast to avoid hitting allies.

## Personal DMing Style: Damage as Vigor

This is a personal rule for DMs, and it's not a formal rule change. It expands the possibilities of combos and makes certain in-game actions more thematic.

Think of hit points (HP) not just as physical health but also as a character's vigor, will, and spirit. A character can't train to take more arrows to the stomach; one arrow should be fatal. Instead, combat damage could represent a loss of nerve, focus, or spirit. A character might dodge an attack, but the sheer terror of it still "does damage" to them, taking away their will to fight. Healing spells could restore this vigor and spirit, not just mend physical wounds.

This allows for more creative combat actions. An archer, for example, can do more than just hit a target. They can fire a distracting arrow to spook an enemy or simply hold their arrow poised, giving an evil smirk as their target is engulfed by a Fireball.

In my opinion, a character would only begin to take actual physical damage once their HP drops to the bottom quarter of their life pool. This makes more sense for non-lethal damage. However, this rule would not apply to barbarians, who are crazy and "earn their scars." For them, physical damage might begin at 75% HP since they can truly endure more than others
